## The beginning
When I was 10 year old I play many games like Minecraft *OwO*.

## Joined Discord
I joined discord after 3 years. Im 13 "Discord". I created my own server and found some friends I invited them to my server. There I gave admin to my best friend called "Glitched" my best friend we had play with many discord bots and I also got soemthing like "what if I made a discord bot"  I searched how to code a discord bot in google then I found out there is something called "discord.js" but still i wasnt understand so I tried to copy codes from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: I found some open source codes so I was tried to use them in my PC but ..... my pc wasnt able to handle it was started lagging :pensive: I still didn't give up....

## The code editor
I searched google for online editors then I found [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) I runned many codes there and everything got unsuccessfull. Then I started cloning the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: and used [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) test the code. It worked first time then I started editing the codes inside of those javascript. Then it made me learn some new things like variables. I even made my own custom messages. After clonning and editing many repos I learned how to make a Discord bot online with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### More things up coming soon :^D
